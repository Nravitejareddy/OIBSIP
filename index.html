            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist whose ideas transformed humanity’s understanding
                of space, time, energy, and the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                A philosopher and humanist, he believed science must serve humanity and peace.
                His work bridged imagination and logic, changing modern civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
                His theories of relativity, contributions to quantum mechanics,
                and the equation <strong>E = mc²</strong> made him the most iconic scientist in history.

            <h2>Publications & Thought</h2>
            <p class="quote">“Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.”</p>
            <p>
                Einstein’s publications revolutionized physics. His 1905 papers introduced special relativity
                and the photoelectric effect, while his 1915 work on general relativity redefined gravity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of his ideas were confirmed decades later, proving the power of deep thought experiments
                guided by mathematical precision.

                <h3>Elevator Experiment</h3>
                <p>
                    Einstein imagined a person inside a falling elevator and realized that gravity and acceleration feel identical, forming the Equivalence Principle, the foundation of General Relativity.

                <h3>Chasing a Light Beam</h3>
                <p>
                    By imagining chasing a beam of light, he concluded that light speed is constant, forcing time and space to become relative — the birth of Special Relativity.

                    Einstein explained the random motion of particles in fluids, providing proof of atoms and influencing the development of statistical mechanics and quantum theory.

                <p>
                    Max Planck was among the first to recognize Einstein’s genius.
                    Their ideas jointly shaped the foundations of quantum physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite contrasting personalities, they shared music,
                    friendship, and a passion for fundamental truth.

                <h2>Awards & Honors</h2>
                <p>
                    Einstein received the Nobel Prize for explaining the photoelectric effect,
                    a cornerstone of modern quantum mechanics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The element <strong>Einsteinium</strong> was named in his honor,
                    symbolizing his timeless scientific legacy.
